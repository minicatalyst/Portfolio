          <p> Bookkeeping is crucial to the success of a business. Small business owners may not feel it necessary to hire a bookkeeper especially if they keep basic records of their finances. This thought process, however,
           is detrimental to the overall success of a business. Your finances tell a story of your business. The better the story is recorded; the clearer vision you have as to whether your business is operating at its optimal level. Like any good story, your records should show a specific overview of details regarding your finances. </p>

      <h3>What kinds of things does bookkeeping entail?</h3>
    </header>
          <code>
          <p> Bookkeeping is basic accounting that businesses utilize to make sure that their finances are correctly organized and filed. Bookkeeping is essential for the financial health of a business. When transactions are recorded, internal and external users can easily see the financial security within a business.  For filing purposes as well, the IRS requires business owners to maintain records of receipts, purchases, expenses, assets, and any other transactions related to business activities. Inaccurate reporting can set you back legally and prevent the succession of your business. Therefore, bookkeeping throughout the year helps business owners abide by regulations and provide all the necessary documentation when it is needed. Bookkeeping is beneficial to the owner as well. It creates an organized overview of the status of the business and can remind owners of obligations they can pursue and when to pursue them in a convenient manner. This provides the owner with clarity when decision making and planning for the future of their company. A responsible business owner has clean looking books and can present these to investors as well. Getting loans is already hard, maintaining proper accounting records will ensure fewer delays in business owners receiving financial help to grow their business.</p>

    </header>
          <code>
          <p>The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is the organization that establishes standards of financial reporting in the United States. To make sure business owners are following the regulations of the FASB, they must keep detailed records of their finances. Without bookkeeping, providing this information is a difficult and timely task, and when done improperly, can lead to a business being denied loans and investments or even put under legal review. The IRS does not require a specific type of recordkeeping, if it clearly shows your income and expenses and provides all the necessary information related to your area of business, it will be accepted. However, keeping clean, organized records is the goal because it saves time in the long run. Investors also look at your financial records to ensure whether your company is a quality investment opportunity. For this reason, your books should be organized and easy to read. Moreover, the quality of the bookkeeping will make you look like the responsible business owner you are, and investment opportunities will no doubt fall into your lap. Once again, your finances and records tell a story to external users so make sure you have well-kept books.</p>
